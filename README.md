Quiz app challenge from iOS Bootcamp course of Angela Yu. 

What I learned in this project:

* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Buttons.
* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Learn about Swift Structures how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types. 
* Learn about Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to refactor code and stay organised.

Note: I updated folder names as iOS 14. This project created with the latest version of Xcode and project file updated with xcode to the final version. iOS 13 in title and folders was added by  to the course's instructor and left their to referenced for outdated course material.
